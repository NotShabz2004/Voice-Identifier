# Voice Identifier ML Model

A simple Machine Learning project to recognize a speaker's voice from a set of recorded samples.

## Features
- Accepts 4 speaker samples.
- Predicts speaker identity based on input voice.
- Implemented basic data preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Handles overfitting issues (in progress).

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- Librosa (for audio feature extraction)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open and run:

VoiceIdentifier.py

4. Train the model with sample audio inputs.

## Future Improvements
- Expand dataset for better generalization.
- Implement model regularization techniques.
- Build a simple web-based user interface.
