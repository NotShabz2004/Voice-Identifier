# Voice-Identifier
Able to learn the voices of people and then identify when given a clip. Accepts files (.wav,mp3.ogg)
You can edit the code as required and choose whose voices need to be identified. Currently I have chosen Rayyan, Swen, Riyaad and Adithya as my dataset.
Also by adding more voices I was able to solve the overfitting issue, where the machines learns too well and is unable find differences. This can be avoided by adding more variance in voice.
